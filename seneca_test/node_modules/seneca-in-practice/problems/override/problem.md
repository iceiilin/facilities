The action patterns that we define are unique. They can trigger only one
function. The patterns resolve using the following rules:

* More properties win.
* If the patterns have the same number of properties, they are matched 
  in alphabetical order.
* If you declare two times the same pattern, the latest will be the one 
  used in a instance, as there can't be two equal patterns in it.

These rules are designed to be simple so that you can run them in your head.
Itâ€™s very easy to understand which pattern will trigger which action function.

It is sometimes useful to have a way of enhancing the behavior of an action
without rewriting it fully. For example, we might want to perform custom
validation of the message properties, capture message statistics,
add additional information to action results, or throttle message flow rates.

So for instance, thinking about hello example, we could override the service
to save statistics about the names.


```javascript
var seneca = require('seneca')()
var names = {}

seneca.add({role:'greetings', cmd:'hello'}, function( msg, respond ) {
    var hello = "Hello " + msg.name;
    respond( null, { answer: hello });
});

seneca.add({role:'greetings', cmd:'hello'}, function( msg, respond ) {

   // saving names statistics in names array
   names[msg.name]=  names[msg.name] ? names[msg.name] + 1 : 1

   // call previous action function for role:greetings,cmd:hello
   this.prior({
     role:  'greetings',
     cmd:   'hello',
     name:  msg.name
   }, function( err, result ) {
     if( err ) return respond( err )

     respond( null, { answer: result.answer });
   })
});

```

The Seneca instance provided to an action function via the the `this` context
variable has a special `prior` method that calls the previous action definition
for the current action pattern.

The prior function has two parameters:

* msg: the msg object, which you may have modified.
* response_callback: a callback function where you can modify the result.

The goal of the exercise is to override the sum plugin with the "addition" action
expecting the left and right properties to be finite numbers.
If one of the number is not a finite number the plugin should throw a
`new Error('Expected left and right to be numbers.')`.
You could use `isFinite` global function to do validate numbers (dont' use
`Number.isFinite` since it doesn't do the type conversion needed on args).
In order to verify that the `prior` call has been done, we would like to add
logging info to the result. So add a `info` property to the result that will
concat numbers in this way: `msg.left + ' + ' + msg.right`. Override the `sum`
already defined and not the sum extended to force integer-only arithmetic.

When you have completed your program, you can run it with:

    {bold}seneca-in-practice run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

    {bold}seneca-in-practice verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness.
After you have a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and
select the next problem!
