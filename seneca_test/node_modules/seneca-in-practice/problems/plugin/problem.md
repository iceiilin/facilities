When you use the Seneca framework, you write plugins all the time. This is an
easy way to organize your action patterns.

A Seneca plugin is just a function that gets passed an {italic}options{/italic}
object, and has a Seneca instance as its {italic}this{/italic} variable.
You then {italic}add{/italic} some action patterns in the body of the function,
and youâ€™re done. There is no callback.

So an example of seneca plugin could be something like this:

```javascript
var plugin = function(options) {

   this.add({role:'greetings', cmd:'hello'}, function(msg, respond) {
         var hello = "Hello " + msg.name;
         respond(null, {answer: hello });
     });  
}
```

It's possible to assign a name to a plugin. In order to do that you need return
a string from the plugin definition function, like this:

```javascript
var plugin = function(options) {

   this.add({role:'greetings', cmd:'hello'}, function(msg, respond) {
         var hello = "Hello " + msg.name;
         respond(null, {answer: hello });
     });  

   return 'interaction'
}
```

Once defined the above plugin could be loaded in this way:

```javascript
var seneca = require('seneca')()

var plugin = function(options) { ... } // as above

seneca.use( plugin, {} )
seneca.ready(function(err) {
  seneca.act( {role:'greetings', cmd:'hello', name:'michele'}, console.log )
})

```

The `seneca.use` is going to load the plugin: `seneca.ready` will provide the callback
for when the plugin has been loaded. Any error that will happen while loading will be passed 
via the `err` param. One thing that we should be aware is that order matter when 
loading plugins. So for instance if you load two plugins declaring the same message pattern
only the last one will be the one handling the message. Keep it in mind!

The goal of the exercise is to write a plugin called `operations` that sums two
numbers, as we did for the first step. For the purpose of this exercise, ***do not
require Seneca directly*** just create a module that exports a function that defines
the patterns, using `this.add` instead of `seneca.add` as we did in previous step.

When you have completed your program, you can run it with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy with it, you can run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness.
After you have a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and
select the next problem!
